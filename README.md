### Description

My application is a Clicking Game where each player that connects will be greeted with a red button that read "Click Me". Upon clicking the button, a new button will appear in a random spot on the screen and 1 point will be added to that player's score. Each new player that connects will have their own name on the leaderboard (player1, then player2, etc.) and their name will be removed upon disconnecting.

### Challenges Faced

Using the demo link provided made the exercise very easy. The only problem I faced was coming up with a good idea for an application, but once I settled on a Clicking Game, there was no other challenges.
