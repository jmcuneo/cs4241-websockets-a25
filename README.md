# ICE 05: Websockets

### Group
Nathaniel Schneider

Websocket chat, this application is a chat which mimics the whatsapp or imessage look of sending a text. You have the option to enter a name and the chat pushes your message on the right so you can easily identify your own sent messages. When recieving a message it will put the name of the sender before so you know who sent you a message!

Challenges faced: getting the messages to have different formatting depending on whether they were sent or recieved. Just had to learn a little svelt to solve it though!
