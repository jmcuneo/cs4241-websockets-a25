# ICE 05: Websockets

In this activity, you will work in groups to build a simple websockets application

### In Class Assignment 5
## Group info
*Group Number*: 20
*Group Members*: Aaron Waller, Tien Nguyen, Benadict Antwi

## Application information

This is an extension of the in-class demo that was done that incorporates the ability for different users to chat with each other and each user being identifiable by their username in the chats.

In order to run the application you simply need to run the command:
```powershell
node server.js
```
As the vite code has been built to be servable from the server.

Difficulties in achieving the product were related to the initial creation and structure of the project.
