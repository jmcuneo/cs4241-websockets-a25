This project was created by Elijah Gray, I apologize for the late submission as I was having some medical issues.
note: It did initially slip my mind to do it yesterday so that is on me.

This is an extremely simply chat site that announces when you join and lets people have usernames in the chat.
the website loads up old messages from the chat log. The interface leaves much to be desired but I was in a rush.

I was assisted by AI when trying to get svelte setup as I was having significant trouble. I reused some old code from
previous assignments as well. My biggest usage was when trying to figure out how to get messages back and forth and seeing
lots of examples.

I also consulted geeks4geeks but I lost the page I had been referencing. I tried to cite wherever possible.
