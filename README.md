# ICE 05: Websockets

Group 14: Isabel Rivera-Cruz, Christine Ngo, Kaylie Quach

We attempted to make a grid multiplayer clicker using the demo, however we weren't able to get it fully functional before the end of class. The intention behind out application was building off the sample index.html in the Socket demo to allow clickable grids between 3 players with varying colors. The biggest challenge we faced was getting socket to create realtime updating between different browsers. We were able to get the grid and clickable cells up and running fairly quickly, but was not able to extend socket to handle 3 realtime clients nor handle color updating between different browsers.
