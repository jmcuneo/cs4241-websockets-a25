# ICE 05: Websockets
## Group 1
### Nia Junod, Arianna Xie, Charles Sibal, Michael Lin, Grace Mahoney

In this activity, you will work in groups to build a simple websockets application

### Instructions

2. Implement the basic websockets setup demo from the [sockets guide](https://github.com/jmcuneo/cs4241-guides/blob/master/using.sockets.md). Make sure that is up and running correctly before proceeding to the next step.

3. Using the demo as a starting point, create a simple networked web application. Make sure the application can handle everybody in your group. Be creative, but manage your time and expectations wisely so that you have a complete application to submit by the end of class.

4. Write up a README file that includes the names of all of your group members and a description of what the application does. Be sure to list anything a user might need to know before using your application. Also describe any challenges your group faced.

5. Submit your final assignment by initiating a pull request against this repo.

**NOTE:** The demo uses Svelte, but you are welcome to switch to a different UI framework if you prefer.
