The application implements a really simple roll the dice game, where the first player to roll a the same number in one roll wins. The user shouldn't face any difficulty using the application, the intructions are straightforard. Once a player wins the game, any player can press the reset button to start a new game. Once the server is running, the server increments the player ID and updates it, this will reset once the server is spun down.
