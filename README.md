Hrithika & Aditri

Description:
This is a real time web chat app that uses Svelte, Express, and websockets. Clients can send messages to each other instantly across multiple browser tabs.

** we also tried making the drawing application in the guide and that worked! One client would click on the screen, creating squares. The other client in the other tab could see the squares in a different color (Red). It would be vice versa for the former user. 

** we also tried to use shacn components but ran into svelte path issues. this version in a branch on the og repo.

Challenges we faced:
- getting the set up working --> we were having trouble with package.json not being generated properly
- it took a couple of tries to run the application, kept saying modules weren't found. 
- Hrithika could not write to the repo despite being listed as a collaborator.
