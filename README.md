This program enhances the basic messaging software by adding names, so every other user isn't just "Them" and more than 2 users can effectively exchange telephone messages. It also sets the background to a random color for each user for fun. 

Two users are able to play a game of telephone with our application. One user will send a message and then the message will have a character switched and the other user will have to guess the original message(not through the application). 

Start a server by running npm run dev on one terminal and node server.js on another. On the given local host, load and and give your name when prompted! You will be connected to other browsers on the localhost.
