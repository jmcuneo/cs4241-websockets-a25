## Project Description

This application is a simple websocket that allows users to connect to a chat service where messages are broadcast to all users. The server uses the Node.js ws library to handle simple communication among users. The addition I made was to keep count of how many users are connected at any time. The chat will also update users with a current count of all users on the application whenever someone connects or disconnects. The project is extremely simple but I thought it fair because I was working solo. The styling was done with the use of AI. 

To use the project, simply type npm start in the terminal and connect to the application through the browser. Using two tabs is necessary to have users interact with each other.
