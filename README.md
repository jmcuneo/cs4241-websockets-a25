# ICE 05: Websockets 
Amanda Longo

I created Textopia which is just a simple texting platform for multiple clients to join and text back and forth! I made it look pretty too

There was no ICE group that was open, I completed this by myself because I was at a conference during the class that completed the ICE05

### Instructions 
to run 
1. cd ICE05-AmandaLongo
2. node server.js
3. open multiple tabs to create new users in th chat!
4. enter your name to be entered into the chat
5. simple texting platform where you can send messages back and forth

### Challenges
1. it was a little challenging managing svelte on my own but overall this was a good learning experience on my end.
