# ICE 05: Websockets
## Brandon Yeu

This application allows users to send messages to other users, focusing on transparency. When a user opens the application, it will ask for their name. When a message is sent, all users can see that there is a new message, but the message is blocked for all other users until they click on the message. Once they click on the message, it will show that user has read the message, so that everyone can see who has or hasn't read it.

To run the application, cd into websocket-tutorial, run npm run dev in one terminal, and run node server.js in another terminal
